## ‚úÖ Supporting

Not everyone has the time or technical knowledge to help out with many of the above - we understand that. With this in mind, here are a few other ways to help us out that don't require as much time or dedication.

- **üíà Advertising:** Spread the word to your friends or on your social media of choice! If you like what we're doing here, getting more people involved is the best way to help improve it.
- **üíµ Donations:** I've invested a lot of my free time into this app. Feel free to check out my [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/meenbeese/) and donate any amount you are able to!
- **üì¢ Politics:** Free software is, in fact, a very political thing. Consider supporting FOSS applications and services over their proprietary counterparts whenever you can.

## üìù Contributions

Habitic is written by users - everyone working on this project (including myself) is motivated entirely by their own needs and ideals. There is no professional support line to handle complaints or paid development team to fix bugs. Anyone that volunteers their time and expertise to improve this app does so without any obligation or commitment to the users of this software.

As a contributor, you are highly valued - any contribution, no matter how small, misled, or incorrectly formatted, is welcome. We'd much prefer to work together and resolve an issue than turn any genuine effort away. **If you need help with this process, have any questions or confusion, or want to get feedback before a contribution, please don't hesitate to get in touch.**

## ‚úèÔ∏è Acknowledgements

I would like to give a huge thanks to all of Habitic [contributors](https://github.com/meenbeese/Habitic/graphs/contributors), the developers that write the software we depend on, and the users that support our goal. Also, props to [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/about/) for maintaining the free software repository that distributes our app and many others like it.

I have received a lot of thanks from various people for the time I've put into this, and that thought helps me get up in the morning. If someone fixes a bug you encountered, helps you out in an issue, or implements a feature you enjoy, please consider sending them a tip or a thank-you note to let them know that you appreciate their time :)
